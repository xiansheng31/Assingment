	<p>Hello, my name is Lim Xian Sheng, and I am from Klang. Also is a student from Taylors University Lakeside Campus.</p>
	<p>I found that HTML is actually a fun thing to play with. Of course, with the help of Mr. Chew it makes HTML look more easier!</p>
	<p>Besides, I am not comfortable with settling, and I'm always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness. </p>
	<p>Finally, during free time I would spend the time wisely by reading some news or do anything that will increase my knowledge and networth.</p>
